Speedometer 2.8 - 2011-12-08

 * Added a linear scale option: -l.  Best used in combination with
   -m (and possibly -n) to customize the range to be displayed.
   Thanks to jukie.net for sponsoring this feature.

 * Replace silly "curved" reading with a weighted moving average

 * New option to display all values in bits per second: -s

 * New options to set minimum (-n) and maximum (-m) values
   displayed on the graphs in bytes/s.
   Defaults are -n 32 and -m 2**32

 * Accept shortened versions of -rx and -tx: -r and -t
   My intent is to drop use of the original forms in 3.0 and add
   --long-versions of all options

 * Use IEC notation of sizes MiB, GiB etc.

 * Install script as both speedometer.py and speedometer


Speedometer 2.7 - 2010-11-08

 * Work better with light, dark and transparent backgrounds

 * Added monochrome and 88/256 color modes

 * New option to exit once a monitored download completes

 * Requires Urwid 0.9.9.1 or later


Speedometer 2.6 - 2008-05-30

 * Increase scale maximum to > 1GB/s

 * Hide Python traceback when user presses ^C

 * Make using plain text mode when Urwid is unavailable the default

 * Make blocky and smoothed modes look more similar

 * Fix simulation and file progress bugs


Speedometer 2.5 - 2007-10-20

 * Use Urwid's raw_display instead of curses_display module

 * Use regexp instead of find for parsing network information


Speedometer 2.4 - 2006-04-09

 * New -z option treats files that don't exist as zero length so
   speedometer will not wait for them to be created at startup.

 * Multiple file taps may now be used stacked vertically in the
   same column.


Speedometer 2.3 - 2006-03-08

 * Graphs may now be displayed with 8 times the resolution of old blocky
   graphs using a new UTF-8 smoothed display mode.  Requires UTF-8 capable
   terminal in UTF-8 encoding (try uxterm) and Urwid 0.9.1 or later.

 * Use math.log without base for compatibility with Python 2.1.


Speedometer 2.2 - 2005-12-27

 * Read network statistics from /proc/net/dev instead of /sbin/ifconfig.
   Reduces CPU usage by 75% on test machine.
   Thanks to Don Rozenberg for the patch.


Speedometer 2.1 - 2005-11-05

 * New simultaneous display of multiple graphs with options for stacking
   graphs vertically or horizontally

 * New labels to differentiate each graph

 * Removed 0-32 B/s from display to make more room for higher speeds

 * Fixed a wait_creation bug


Speedometer 2.0 - 2005-10-21

 * New full-console bar graph display based on Urwid 0.8.9

 * Realigned graphic scale to more common units


Speedometer 1.4 - 2003-07-18

 * New average and "smoothed" readings added


Speedometer 1.3 - 2003-05-19
